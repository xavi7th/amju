            <h2>REPORT ABOUT MICROFINANCE BANKING IN NIGERIA</h2>
						<ul class="list-xxl">
              <li>
                <ul class="list-marked">
									<li>The number of microfinance banks licensed in the country by the Central Bank of Nigeria stood at 898 as of February 13, 2019.</li>
									<li>It is the prime objective of a good microfinance bank to enhance the improvement of poor living conditions.</li>
									<li>They also facilitate the promotion of agricultural products and help create employment opportunities. Micro-finance banks are key players in this aspect because they specialize in the provision of credit facilities to individuals as well as businesses.</li>
									<li>The Nigerian government cued into this popular thinking in 2005 when it inaugurated the microfinance banking scheme. This was founded to provide finance to economically active poor excluded from financing by conventional banks, provide employment, engender rural development and reduce poverty.</li>
									<li>The purpose of microfinance is to provide financial services to people "generally excluded from traditional banking channels because of their low, irregular and unpredictable income," according to ING, a global financial institution with a strong European base.</li>

            <h2>What Are the Benefits of Microfinance?</h2>
						<div class="heading-6">
              There are literally dozens of benefits for microfinance, but the key pluses involve the role of microfinance in economic development. Vitanna.org and Plan International provide possibly the top benefits of microfinance:

                <ol class="list-marked">
									<li><h4>It allows people to provide for their families.</h4> Through microfinance, more households are able to expand their current opportunities so that more income accumulation may occur, says Vitanna.org, a financial services website.</li>
									<li><h4>It gives people access to credit.</h4> "By extending microfinance opportunities, people have access to small amounts of credit, which can then stop poverty at a rapid pace," says Vitanna.org. Plan International, a global organization dedicated to advancing children’s rights and equality for women, agrees, stating: "Banks simply won’t extend loans to those with little or no assets, and generally don’t engage in the small size of loans typically associated with microfinancing. Microfinancing is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty."</li>
									<li><h4>It serves those who are often overlooked in society.</h4> About 95 percent of some loan products extended by microfinance institutions are given to women, as well as those with disabilities, those who are unemployed, and even those who simply beg to meet their basic needs, Vitanna notes. Microfinance services can help recipients take control of their own lives.</li>
									<li><h4>It creates the possibility of future investments.</h4> Microfinance disrupts the cycle of poverty by making more money available. When basic needs are met, families can then invest in better housing, health care, and even, eventually, small business opportunities.</li>
									<li><h4>It is sustainable.</h4> There's little risk with a $100 or loan, says Vitanna, adding: "Yet $100 could be enough for an entrepreneur in a developing country to pull themselves out of poverty." Plan International agrees, stating that a $100 loan can be enough to launch a small business in a developing country that could help the benefactor pull herself and her family out of poverty.</li>
									<li><h4>It can create jobs.</h4> Microfinance is also able to let entrepreneurs in impoverished communities and developing countries create new employment opportunities for others.</li>
									<li><h4>It encourages people to save.</h4> "When people have their basic needs met, the natural inclination is for them to save the leftover earnings for a future emergency," says Vitanna.</li>
									<li><h4>It offers significant economic gains even if income levels remain the same. </h4> The gains from participation in a microfinance program including access to better nutrition, higher levels of consumption, and eventually, growing economies, even in small and impoverished communities.</li>
									<li><h4>It leads to better loan repayment rates. </h4> "Microfinance tends to target women borrowers, who are statistically less likely to default on their loans than men. So these loans help empower women, and they are often safer investments for those loaning the funds," says Plan International. </li>
									<li><h4>It extends education.  </h4> Families receiving microfinance services are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons, says Plan International.</li>

						<p>
             Microfinance, then, may involve very small loans and financial services, but it has a worldwide impact over the last four-plus decades. For a small business that needs just a bit of extra cash or credit to secure a new opportunity, microfinance may be just the ticket. And for a small lending or banking business looking for new opportunities, microfinance literally offers a world of opportunities – one small loan or financial service at a time.

						<h2>REGULATORY REPORT</h2>
            <div class="heading-6">
							<h4>CBN DRAFT PRUDENTIAL GUIDELINES FOR MICROFINANCE BANKS (“MFBs”) </h4>
              As part of its efforts at enhancing the quality of banks’ assets, the CBN in June 2010 issued the Prudential Guidelines for Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) in Nigeria. These 2010 Guidelines had provisions that covered microfinance loans. However, given the developments which have had specific impact on different classes of financial institutions over the years, the need for sectorspecific Guidelines has arisen. On August 23, 2019, the CBN circulated the draft guidelines for MFBs, for any observations and comments. Below are some highlights in the Guidelines:
            </div>
						<ul class="list-xxl">
              <li>
                <ol class="list-marked">
									<li><h4> Lending Limits.</h4> The maximum loan to any individual borrower shall not exceed 1 per cent and to any group of borrowers, co-operative or corporate body, it shall not exceed 5 per cent of the MFB’s shareholder’s fund unimpaired by losses or as may be prescribed by the CBN.</li>
									<li><h4> Increase in the Credit Print-out Minimum Requirements.</h4> Borrowers credit print-out requirements have been extended to include the following: (i) Interest rate; (ii) Restructure date (if any); (iii) Type and value of security pledged; (iv) Bank Verification Number (BVN); and (v) Evidence of registration with the National Collateral Registry (NCR).</li>
									<li><h4>  Co-signers as Borrowers: </h4> Members in a group lending arrangement shall now be allowed to co-sign as borrowers or issue cross-guarantees for one another to the same MFB. </li>
									<li><h4>  Restrictions on Financing: </h4> MFBs shall not be allowed to finance any of the following , other than from the shareholders’ funds unimpaired by losses: (i) Acquisition of fixed assets; (ii) Equity investments in permissible activities and investments in long-term debentures, subject to CBN’s approval in writing; and (iii) Branch expansion. </li>
									<li><h4> Compliance: </h4>  Compliance with provisions of the Code of Corporate Governance for MFBs as issued by the CBN circular FPR/DIR/CIR/ GEN/07/017 dated October 26, 2018 or any other relevant circular(s) issued by the CBN. 4.2.3 DRAFT PRUDENTIAL GUIDELINES</li>
